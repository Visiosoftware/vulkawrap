*Simplifying Vulkan*

# VulkaWrap

VulkaWrap intends to simplify Vulkan by wrapping the functionality into a cleaner C++ interface, resulting in less code, but still allowing the contorol and configurability of native Vulkan code.

Numerous examples will be included to demonstrate the use of the library. Additionally, documentation will be added shortly, and will be updated each time new functionality is introduced.

If there are any specific examples you would like to see implemented, send me an email at [robjclucas@gmail.com](@mailto:robjclucas@gmail.com).
